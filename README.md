# Numerical simulations of on-chip generation of 4-partite GHZ states

Numerical simulations based on a phenomenological model of an experimental apparatus using the linear optical circuit framework Perceval. This code is used in a scientific project that demonstrate a high fidelity preparation of path-encoded 4-qubit GHZ states on a tunable glass photonic chip.

This script requires a specific fork of the paskage Perceval:
pip install git+https://github.com/MathiasPnt/Perceval.git@imperfect_sps

The notebook "Path-encoded_4GHZ_generator" is used to reconstruct the density matrix from measured indistinguishability and multiphoton compoonent.
